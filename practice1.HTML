        I was struggling to decide what to populate my test with something, so I ended up pulling something from the last time I was in formal education.

            Up first are the three poems that make up the <span class="italics-text"><strong>Editor</strong></span> collection. Yes, the mistakes in the first two are deliberate...

            <h3>I</h3>
            <p>
            I know the first draft, 
            Is ussually shit, 
            Littered with mistakes, 
            and identity crisis. 
            Can I get the meaning across? 
            Does my black and white, 
            Spell the rainbow? 
            </p>
            <p>
            I make mum read it, 
            The feedback was positive, 
            But not usefull. 
            Need even more help still, 
            To perfect what may become,  
            My best poem yet. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I know I’m always to verbose, 
            I need to cut down the words. 
            Get ready to get my hands dirty. 
            Find the point of the poem, 
            And sharpen it 
            To a razor. 
            </p>
            
            
        <h3>III</h3>
            
        <ul>
            
                <li>This must be the third time,</li>
                <li>I’ve checked over this poem.</li>
                <li>still searching for grammar,</li>
                <li>and spelling mistakes.</li>
                <li>Does my message comute?</li>
                <li>Do my blacks and whites</li>
                <li>Paint the rainbows?</li>

            </ul> 
            
            <ul>
                <li>I need to operate,</li>
                <li>To salvage what I can.</li>
                <li>“Give me a scalpel.</li>
                <li>perhaps the chisel?”</li>
                <li>Trim the fat,</li>
                <li>Mend the bone,</li>
                <li>Feed it protein.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>I made them read it,</li>
                <li>My mum, cousin, friend.</li>
                <li>It’s taking some shape,</li>
                <li>Eventualy.</li>
                <li>“Help me to perfect,</li>
                <li>what may always be imperfect.”</li>
            </ul>   
            
        
            
            
            <h3>XII</h3> 
            <p class="finalDraft">
            This must be the twelfth time <br>
            I’ve read this poem. <br>
            There were no spelling mistakes <br>
            by draft four. <br>
            Does my message transcend? <br>
            Do my blacks and whites <br>
            Paint the greys? <br>
            </p>
            <p class="finalDraft">
            I became the surgeon, <br>
            Put on the apron. <br>
            Pass me the scalpel. <br>
            Perhaps the bone saw? <br>
            Liposuction  <br>
            Cast <br>
            Toning diet <br>
            </p>
            <p class="finalDraft">
            I made them all read it, <br>
            My mum, <br>
            My cousin, <br>
            My friend. <br>
            Took it to the workshop. <br>
            Help me perfect <br>
            This perpetual imperfection. <br>
            This poem I’m sick of reading. <br>
